"Pierwszy Krok" means "The first step".

A proverb says that "a journey of thousand miles begins with a single step". This song is the first step in a journey, even if it ends up being one step long.

Some guitar fragments used in the song started appearing in Gda≈Ñsk in 2022. What established them into a song was inspiration of living and surfing on Fuerteventura, accidentally renting an aerophone and breathing out the cello and flute sounds that bound the fragments together.

During a month-long backpack trip I didn't have any instruments. At some point in Corralejo I decided to rent a guitar and just after someone said "I doubt you could rent guitar here", we noticed a wooden guitar rental symbol with Eric's number on the wall. During the night I realised that it doesn't have to be a guitar, so when I called Eric the next day, I said I would like to rent an instrument. I had a feeling that he has something I need, though I didn't know what it was. When we met, I came up with a hint that it might be nice if the instrument was somehow connected with the breath. That's when it clicked in Eric's mind, he explained to me what wind instruments are and gave me the Roland Aerophone AE-10, along with a micro portable speaker. A basic "beach guitar" was offered as a bonus :)

This is the first version of the song that consists of separate loops. Most, if not all, of them were recorded on a smartphone with the help of Loopify app. Comparing to the previous version, there are less improvised, more structured guitar solos, including an initial version of the slide solo on the BacaSound guitar. Initial ideas for drums and bass are added too, made using an old keyboard. The main guitar theme is replaced by an encore just before the end of the song.
